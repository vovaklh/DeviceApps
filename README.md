# MyApps

Sometimes it is hard to find the concrete app on your phone, especially if you have many installed of them. The MyApps solves this problem! You can search your app just by typing its name. Or you can use voice search! The app supports dark mode and English/Russian languages. It is possible to filter apps by its name, size and date.
